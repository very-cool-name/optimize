Cellular automata based on [Prisoner's dillema](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma).
Can be run with command `python3 automat.py '1 1' 1 grid_file grid` meaning that it will print result in cell 1 1 after 1 rounds of simulation. Grid will be read from grid file, [example here](./grid)
